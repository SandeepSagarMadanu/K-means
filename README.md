# KMA - Knowledge-based Medical Assistant 🧠💊

A Knowledge-based Medical Assistant (KMA) that leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to process and classify health-related data, assisting in diagnosis prediction. The system is trained using a medical dataset and deployed using a Python-based notebook.

## 📌 About

This project is designed to assist healthcare professionals and patients by classifying medical data into meaningful insights. It uses supervised machine learning techniques on a structured medical dataset to perform classification tasks such as predicting disease conditions.

Key functionalities:
- Load and preprocess medical CSV dataset
- Visualize correlations and distributions
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models
- Output performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Provide prediction results for test inputs

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files

- `KMA.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the implementation and results
- `dataset.csv`: The dataset used for model training and testing

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kma-medical-assistant.git
   cd kma-medical-assistant

📊 Model Evaluation
Evaluation metrics used:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

These metrics ensure balanced performance, especially for healthcare predictions where false positives/negatives have critical impact.

🔍 Dataset
The dataset is structured in CSV format and contains multiple medical attributes used for classification. It includes labeled outputs, which are crucial for supervised learning.
